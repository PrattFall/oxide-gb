# Oxide-gb

Decided I wanted to write a gameboy emulator so here it is in all its
uncompleted glory! No graphics or sound yet, still only about 1/4 of the way
through implementing CPU operations. Pretty sure half of it is misnamed.

It's a great time :)

## Resources

I've pretty much only used the following resources to build this. 
With a couple exceptional function definitions that I just couldn't figure out.

- [This wonderful OP Codes chart](https://meganesu.github.io/generate-gb-opcodes/)
- [This amazing Gameboy documentation](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/)
